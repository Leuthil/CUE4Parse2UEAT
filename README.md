# CUE4Parse2UEAT Project
Converts [CUE4Parse](https://github.com/FabianFG/CUE4Parse) objects into [UEATSerializer](https://github.com/Leuthil/UEATSerializer) objects (UEAssetToolkit format). WIP. Currently Import object class package names are incorrect if class package is not `IoPackage` (IO Store). Hard-coded for Hogwarts Legacy game files at the moment.

# CUE4Parse2UEAT-CLI Project
Provides a sample of how to use CUE4Parse2UEAT. Very hard-coded at the moment.
